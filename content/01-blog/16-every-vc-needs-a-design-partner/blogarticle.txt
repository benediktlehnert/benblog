In a startup, a VC should be a partner who supports you in building and growing your business by sharing his knowledge and giving advice. I’ve met many great VCs with a broad knowledge in numbers and strategy, but yet when it comes to product, brand and design, young entrepreneurs still often feel like they’re on their own. I therefore strongly believe that every modern VC firm must have the same competences in design that they have in business and strategy. Or they are going to risk a lot of money due to not unlocking the potential of the companies they fund.

We live in world where it’s easy to write code and start a company, but still hard to get that code into the hands of normal people and to turn them into customers. Design is at the core of every business. And when I say design, I mean it in the broad sense. Usually, people don’t stick to a product that just looks good on the surface. What customers are looking for are delightful experiences that make them happy every time they get in touch with a product, brand or company. That’s what people are willing to pay for and what turns them into customers. Thus, designing and constantly improving the customer’s experience has an immediate impact on the success of your business. But creatives are strange people. They are hard to work with and sometimes tend to be reluctant, especially if you just bark orders at them. However, if you’re one of them, speak their language and manage to inspire them, they’ll happily follow your advice.

That’s why every VC needs a Design Partner—someone who understands that customer experience is more than just product design, but also brand management and marketing strategy. Someone who has been in the trenches and is now the wiser because of it. Someone who is able to lead, guide and inspire. Someone who gives advice on the grand vision as well as the tiny details that make the product experience unforgettable. Someone who is a designer by heart and a business strategist by training. While knowledge in design is one part, it’s often *execution* where young teams need guidance and advice. Having an experienced mentor—with a (link: https://medium.com/design-startups/c012e5ad32f7 text: hands-on mentality)—who is able to bridge business and design is not only helpful but essential for a young product-driven company.
