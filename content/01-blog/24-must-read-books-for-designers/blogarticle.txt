Two years ago I published an article with a few book recommendations on (link: http://benedikt-lehnert.de/what-to-read text: what to read). Back then I started curating a list of books I read and think are important if you want to develop a well-rounded design expertise.

I will continue curating more books and update the list from time to time, so please feel free to (link: https://www.wunderlist.com/list/121036190 text: leave a comment) with books you think should be on the list.
