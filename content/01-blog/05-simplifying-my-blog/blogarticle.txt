I am going to redesign my blog. Again. Why? I am absolutely not happy with the current one. Mostly because it’s powered by Wordpress which adds a lot of unnecessary complexity. I finally want to get rid of this. Second, my blog changed a lot over the last months and years. I guess it was due to the fact that I myself changed a lot and so did the purpose of the blog. It has been my “website”, a place where I showed some snippets of work, photo blog and a collection of thoughts.

This weekend I invested some time  to find out, what my blog should look and feel like. I noted down what I want and need due to the fact that there’s more text than pictures on the blog today. The old design (that started years ago with the veryplaintxt theme for Wordpress) was nothing that satisfied my love for great typography and design anymore. And carrying the heavy backpack of old stuff doesn’t solve that.

### 1. Simplicity

I don’t need a real blog system. I don’t even need more than 1 headline, subline and great body text style. What I want is a system that enables me to post easily. Usually I write my post in iA Writer on my iPad while on a plane or waiting somewhere. Getting them into Wordpress is really a pain in the butt, especially because the Wordpress App for iPad simply sucks. I guess that’s one of the reasons why I don’t post more frequently. I don’t even need any comments, ’cause almost nobody used the comments in my blog in the past. Maybe that should make me think, hum?

### 2. Typography

It’s not a secret. I love good typography. But getting beautiful type into a wordpress theme is really hard. At least for me, since I am not a coder and it’s not that easy for me to understand the complex structure of a wordpress theme. I even don’t want to understand it ;)
What I need is really simple: 1 headline, 1 subline and 1 bodytext style. In addition I need nice styles for links and a style for highlighted text. That’s it. And, of course, I need a beautiful typeface (No, not Helvetica).

### 3. Easy way to put my photos in

I am still in love with photography. Although I haven’t shot any new photos in the last weeks, I will proceed training my skills. So, my new blog design should be prepared to showcase photos in a nice and simple way.

### 4. Responsive Design

In order to make the blog really comfortable to read on different devices, I want it to have a responsive layout.

From all the systems I’ve seen so far, I think I’ll give (link: http://www.getkirby.com text: Kirby) a try. I discovered it months ago, introduced it to our team and we started using it for our internal documentation at (link: http://www.6wunderkinder.com text: 6Wunderkinder). So far it is doing great.

I shut down my personal one-pager website. I believe that a blog will represent my personal journey much better than a static website. Something I learned: Only because some other folks have personal websites, it doesn’t mean that I need one, too. Form follow function.
