We have this saying at (link: http://www.6wunderkinder.com text: 6Wunderkinder). It usually happens when we are working on something new and one of our teammates would say: *“This needs more Disney!”*

It sounds funny, but that simple phrase immediately helps us to refocus and gets down to the essence of our work. *“More Disney”* means “there’s the magic missing”. It means there’s no emotional hook. It can also mean “there’s the beauty missing” in the details of a design or a phrase of a blog post. Or it simply means “It doesn’t connect to me”.—Overall it means “we can do better”. These are all essential things to our work. *“More Disney”* also means being reminded, that we create for an audience.

So, how do we get *more Disney* into our work?

### Tell a story
What is your story? Everything has its raison d’etre, its “why”. Make it tangible. Make it experienceable. In your writing, visuals and product experience.

Make your story unique and personal. Be creative, bold and have no fear to leave your audience with their imagination. Give them 2+2 instead of 4 to inspire their imagination.

### Make people smile
No matter, if you’re building a new part of a product, writing a piece of copy or designing a (link: http://dribbble.com/shots/681446-Cupcake?list=users text: marketing creative), make people smile. As a creator of a product or brand experience you want to connect emotionally to your audience. Create a surprising animation, write a really funny error message or tell a joke. With every single detail you get the chance to make people smile.

### Create something for everybody
As designers, engineers and startup people we tend to live in our own bubble. Remember that you create for normal people. There lies a beauty in the simple things. Great stories unfold from a simple sentence such as “Once upon a time...”. Make your experience accessible. Give everybody the chance to connect and to be part of your story. Make it feel as inevitable as possible.

### Master your craft
The beauty of Disney’s art lies in the excellence of their craftsmanship. Excellence needs constant training. Practice and refine your craft every day. Get inspiration from various fields and study the work of other artists. Make your next piece even *“more Disney”* than the one before. Care about every detail as well as the big picture and how it all fits together as one story.

### Sing and dance
People want to be happy. Let’s give them a reason!
