You are searching for a strategy that will make you incredibly successful in the digital age? You are asking yourself how to become the next Facebook, Apple, Google, whatever? You want to earn a ton of money every day and go for the craziest exit in the history of the internet? – Then this is exactly what you should read and do. I put together everything I learned so far. And I found the recipe for building an awesome company. It’s dead simple. And I’ll tell you what the magic sauce is: People.

### Here's how

Start with building an environment that empowers people to raise their potential. There are millions of talented people out there. And they are searching for a place where they can build something great that makes the world a better place. Help them, encourage their curiosity and passion. You’ll see them doing unbelievable things.

And that’s the second step: Realize that your motivation is not making money, but creating stuff that helps other people. Stuff that improves their lives. In other words: build something relevant. Once you figured out how you and your team can contribute to something that moves people forward you should build it in the best way you can. Make it beautiful and easy to use for everybody. Forget about fancy shit that nobody needs. Build it in the most sustainable way.

Then, bring this product/service/idea to market and if you’ve done it right people will see how they benefit from you and – surprise – they will be willing to support you. By spreading the word about you, by paying you money so that you can keep doing great work. That allows you to grow, build an even better place for you and your passionate team. And in the end not only your product will become relevant but also you yourself. Because you contributed to something bigger. You changed peoples lives for the better.

Why I write this? Because I see a lot of people these days wasting their own time and energy to follow a wrong motivation. And they are not only wasting their own time, but also the time of their users. On the other hand I see them having a lot of talent, energy and knowledge that they could use to build better products.

**My conclusion is simple: Focus on people and all else will follow.**
