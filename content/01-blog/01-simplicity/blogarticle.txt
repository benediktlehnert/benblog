I am going to redesign my blog. Again. Why? Because I am absolutely not happy with the current one. Mostly because it’s powered by Wordpress which adds a lot of unnecessary complexity. I finally want to get rid of this.

Second, my blog changed a lot over the last months and years. I guess it was due to the fact that I changed the purpose of the blog a lot. It has been my “website”, a place where I showed some snippets of work, photo blog and a collection of thoughts.

This weekend I invested some time to find out, what my blog should look and feel like. I noted down what I want and need due to the fact that there’s more text than pictures on the blog today. The current design (that started years ago with the veryplaintxt theme for Wordpress) is nothing that satisfies my love for great typography and design. And carrying the heavy backpack of old shit doesn’t solve that.

### 1. Simplicity
I don’t need a real blog system. I don’t even need more than 1 headline, subline and great bodytext style. What I want is a system that enables me to post easily. Usually I write my post in iA Writer on my iPad while on a plane or waiting somewhere. Getting them into Wordpress is really a pain in the butt, especially because the Wordpress App for iPad simply sucks. I guess that’s one of the reasons why I don’t post more frequently. I don’t even need any comments, ’cause almost nobody used the comments in my blog in the past. Maybe that should make me think, hum?

### 2. Typography
It’s not a secret. I love good typography. But getting beautiful type into a wordpress theme is really hard. At least for me, since I am not a coder and it’s not that easy for me to understand the complex structure of a wordpress theme. I even don’t want to understand it ;)
What I need is really simple: 1 headline, 1 subline and 1 bodytext style. In addition I need nice styles for links and a style for highlighted text. That’s it. And, of course, I need a beautiful typeface (No, not Helvetica).
