Description: Hi, my name is Ben and I love making things simple. I design to improve lives. I am working with the amazing team at 6Wunderkinder in Berlin where I am in charge of product design and communications. I love photography in black and white, the sound of water and the smell of fabric softener. As a hobby, I co-created Watches for iPad.

Follow me on Twitter, drop me a line or let’s meet for a coffee.
